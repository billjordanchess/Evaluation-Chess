# Evaluation-Chess
Evaluation-Chess is an experimental chess engine based on my Winboard engine Bitboard-Chess. It uses an external file to use values used in the evaluation function. This can be edited by the user.

The engine has only a basic text interface, however is designed to be used with software that can run Winboard engines, such as Arena. The user may create different versions, each in seperate folders with their own data file. This way different evaluations may be tested.

There are hundreds of values that may be edited. I am currently writing a book about it which will be available at at amazon.com.
